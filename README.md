# Barnes-Hut-N-Body-Simulation
N-body simulation with Barnes-Hut Algorithm. This code is written in python.

Barnes-Hut algorithm is the algorithm for N-body simulation, using k-dimensional tree data structures. Below is the paper I referenced:
Barnes & Hut, "A hierarchical O(N log N) force-calculation algorithm", Nature, 324, pages446â€“449 (1986).
